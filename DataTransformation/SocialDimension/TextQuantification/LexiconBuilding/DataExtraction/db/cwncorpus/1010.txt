You must make sure that you will never live in peace as long as you continue to make conspiracies, fueling wars, spreading evil in the world, creating terrorist organizations... You will never know the peace as long as you are occupying and jailing another nation, so stop your silly dreams, and start thinking of reality...the leaked data has been uploaded in many places and will take some time to go through. https://pastebin.com/NZVGFrcb
