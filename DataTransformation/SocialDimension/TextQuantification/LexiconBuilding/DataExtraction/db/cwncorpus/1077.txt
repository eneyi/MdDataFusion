Hackers Attack Israeli "Sheba" and "Assuta" Hospitals
2012/01/26
Zionops has picked up on a very sad story for hackers, Ddos attacks that disabled the systems websites that belong to hospitals in Israel. this just adds fuel to the fire that has been burning for a couple of weeks now and is turning out to be the "middle east cyber war" Zionops has reported  that unknown hackers have ddos the hospitals websites and have left some words for them. CWN does not agree with these types of attacks at all as these types of services are the ones people use every single day to obtain information for upcoming surgery, problems or  other enquires. Hackers that do such attacks should be ashamed of themselves. unknown-hackers-crashed-israel-sheba-hospital-website/ unknown-hackers-crashed-israel-assuta-hospital-website/
