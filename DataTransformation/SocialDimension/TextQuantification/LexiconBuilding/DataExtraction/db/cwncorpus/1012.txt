The attack which has actually seen two sites defaced and wiped but both show the same defacement. The attacks come on the anniversary of the bahrain uprising. and feature the below message as well as the video "the forth world war" which goes for well over an hour, the attack was announced via the popular @AnonymousIRC twitter account. content/images/gallery/random3/combinedsystems-defaced-and-rmd-by-anonymous-on-anniversary-of-bahrain-uprising.png Other information form the leak is pretty much all the servers data which si now deleted and that contains lots and lots of different user accounts for different parts of the site. _ _ __ __ | || | _____ / |_|| ______ ____ ____ __ / __ / __ |/ // __ / ___ #anonymous | || | / __ | | | | | \ / ___ #antisec / ~~ _ ( /| /| |_/____ ___ ___ | #solidarity |||| / / / / / ################################################################################ COMBINEDSYSTEMS DEFACED AND RM'D BY ANONYMOUS ON ANNIVERSARY OF BAHRAIN UPRISING So you war profiteering all crazy, selling mad chemical weapons to militaries and cop shops around the world, thinking you will get away unscathed by the rising tides of insurrection? Think again, assholes. Combined Systems, lay down your arms: you just lost the game. In the past we have marched on your offices in Jamestown, Pennsylvania: now it is time to march on your websites. All your "less than lethal" arms were simply no match for our 9000 cocks and mad black hat technique. We came, we saw, we rooted and rm'd your website. Umad? From the streets of Oakland to Tahrir Square, to Palestine, Greece, Bahrain and Syria, your sinister instruments of torture and brutality have been used by the vile swine enforcers of the rich ruling classes to repress our revolutionary movements. You shot and gassed protesters, running them off public parks in the US. Several dozen died because of your tear gas used in Egypt. You wave the Israeli flag outside of your offices, while just two months ago your tear gas cannisters fired by the IDF killed a man in the West Bank. Did you think we forgot? Why did you not expect us? In addition to dumping name, address, phone and password information for dozens of CSI employees and clients, our tag team of mayhem went the extra mile by dumping email for some of the pigs ordering anti-protester gear off their shitty website. We also hit sur-tec.com, some shitty CCTV surveillance company owned by former FBI director Clarence M. Kelley (their password was 'government'). Do you think they will appreciate the irony of being owned due to buying "security" products from a compromised website? How long do you think we had your website backdoored, capturing all incoming customers registrations and orders? 42? If you ever get your website back up, do you think you will be anything more than a shadow of your former self? Will your clients ever trust you again? Unfortunately, some random paypal phisher also hacked and abused the server. This noob was reported to the sysadmins by google, forcing us to move forward with our plans ahead of schedule. To the system administrators and web developers who aided and abetted CombinedSystems.com, we got something for your asses too (and it's more than getting pounded with 9000 dildos at maximum vibration speed): if you so much as lift a finger to support CSI in rebuilding their websites, we will post all your mail on you and all your clients (aka The Lolcaust). Any other brave whitehats want to step up to CSI's defense? To our hacker allies, our fellow occupiers, our militant comrades all around the world, the time for talk is over: it's time to hack and smash, beat and shag. Each and every #FuckFBIFriday we will make war on the infrastructure of the military prison industrial non-organic complex, targeting all war profiteers, corporate executives, white hats, snitches and pigs. We're coming to loot, plunder, and make all their base belong to us. You really think you can crush the spirit of the Arab Spring, the Occupation Movement, and Anonymous with tear gas and subpoenas?! Mothafucka, our mad skills iz bulletproof. Now let's bust out that hacklog! <3 video in the defacement.  defaced sites: https://www.combinedsystems.com/ https://handcuffsusa.com/ mirror: https://www.zone-h.org/mirror/id/16969108 So surely this will be up there with the stratfor hacks, but at least these guys encrypt there information a bit better.
