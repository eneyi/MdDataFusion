9,885 User accounts leaked from Intercessors for America by Anonymous
2013/07/25
 An Anonymous hacktivist has tipped us of to a leak of data from the main server for the sites of Intercessors for America. Intercessors for America runs ifapray.org and getamericapraying.com and is associated with god which with what we have seen in the past never plays out well when it comes to the anonymous hacktivist.Intercessors for America (IFA) is a 501(c)(3) ministry organization and got its start  in 1973 when God impressed upon the hearts of a group of godly, respected men the necessity of prayer and fasting. The nation was experiencing a plethora of problems. The Watergate scandal, Vietnam War, Arab oil embargo, Roe v. Wade, a growing acceptance of drug use, and other challenges were changing the way Americans lived and thought.The anonymous hacktivist has posted the leaked data to nopaste.me as a raw sql extraction which contains user accounts and administrator accounts as well as server accounts. Account details are mostly email addresses and clear text passwords with the administrator and server passwords being encrypted. All together there is 9,885 non duplicated email:password combos found. Seeing that this is yet another clear example that these smaller based websites with high traffic from registering visitors are where a lot of the current breaches come from and many like this one store passwords in clear text. In the breach the anonymous hacktivist has made a note:THIS LEAK IS IN THE TRUE SPIRIT OF ANONYMOUS. ANY INDIVIDUAL TRYING TO CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT IS NOT THE HACKER WHO DID IT.*It also appears from the leaked tables of data that they are using wordpress which is known to be exploitable.
