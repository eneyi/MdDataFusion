content/images/gallery/random3/hacked-by-alsa7r.png A tv show, Gossip Girl,  that was based on a popular book has had its official fan site hacked and left in a pretty bad state. The hack has left the website defaced and all the forums and content is not accessible as well as leaking a fairly huge load of data from the website. The attack comes from @alsa7rx who in the past has leaked many other things. At time of publishing the website and forums was all defaced. https://www.gossipgirl.tv/ The leaked data contains usernames, ids, emails and encrypted passwords but @alsa7rx has taken the time to decrypt many of the hashes.
