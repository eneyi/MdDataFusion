Just shy of exactly one month since the last attack it has been taken offline again this time by BBHH, Bangladesh black hat hackers. When checking the site its returning unconnectable, which may suggest they are finally taking time out to fix the exploits that have been taken advantage of time and time again,if not i hhope they do.
