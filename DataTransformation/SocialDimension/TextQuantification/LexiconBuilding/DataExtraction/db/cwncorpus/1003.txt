The most string of websites include these ones below which include the below message about free kasmir.Free Kashmir .. Freedom is our goal..// End the Occupation. . . . ? This institutionalized impunity with which the killings of civilians by military and police forces in Jammu and Kashmir continues should be a source of shame for India which propagates to be a democracy! Kashmir does not want militarized governance - STOP killing children, raping women and imprisoning the men! They just want freedom! Freedom from the evil of the Indian Military! You will never kill the Kashmiri spirit and remember one thing India; Ghandi himself said - Freedom is never dear at any price. It is the breath of life. What would a man not pay for living? Everyday 100s of innocent people are abused, raped and even killed in kashmir by the indian army, a third of the deaths are children, - we dont want war, take back your men, your tanks and your guns and go back to where you came from, all we ask is for freedom, you can kill us but you cant kill us all, we shall not give up, giving up is not an option. who are the real soldiers? the children holding stones or the Army men holding guns?www.yasheshswaly.com  https://jaksmicro.com/ www.zycominfotech.in/ They have also been attacking pinoycyberarmy.com/ which is currently defaced by another hacker team going by the handle of Black Hat Group ~ Iranian HackerZ  who is also attacking them. content/images/gallery/pca/hacked-by-hax-r00t-pakistani-hacker.png
