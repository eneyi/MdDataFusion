You can often treat the flu without seeing your GP and should begin to feel better in about a week.

Check if you have flu
Flu symptoms come on very quickly and can include:
a sudden fever – a temperature of 38C or above
aching body
feeling tired or exhausted
dry, chesty cough
sore throat
headache
difficulty sleeping
loss of appetite
diarrhoea or tummy pain
nausea and being sick
The symptoms are similar for children, but they can also get pain in their ear and appear less active
To help you get better more quickly:
rest and sleep
keep warm
take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower your temperature and treat aches and pains
drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration (your pee should be light yellow or clear)

A pharmacist can help with flu
A pharmacist can give treatment advice and recommend flu remedies.
Be careful not to use flu remedies if you're taking paracetamol and ibuprofen tablets as it's easy to take more than the recommended dose.
Speak to a pharmacist before giving medicines to children.
Antibiotics
GPs don't recommend antibiotics for flu because they won't relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery.
Flu is very infectious and easily spread to other people. You're more likely to give it to others in the first 5 days.
Flu is spread by germs from coughs and sneezes, which can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours.
To reduce the risk of spreading flu:
wash your hands often with warm water and soap
use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze
bin used tissues as quickly as possible
The flu vaccine reduces the risk of catching flu, as well as spreading it to others.
It's more effective to get the vaccine before the start of the flu season (December to March).
